# How to Download/Run/Submit



## Joining the Class on Gradescope

1. Create an account on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) using your *Wellesley College* email.
2. Join the course using the entry code `B3G2B5`.



## Downloading the Homework

1. Log into [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/) using your Wellesley College email. 
2. Go to homework link.
3. Duplicate the homework as *private*. You can do this by clicking on the "..." on the top right corner of the screen, and selected "Duplicate project". When the dialog box pops up, make sure to click the 'make private' button.
4. After the project has been duplicated. Rename it to say: `HW-N: FIRST LAST`, where `N` is the homework number, and `FIRST` and `LAST` are your first and last names.


## DeepNote Setup

**Disabling Generative AI.** Follow [these instructions](https://deepnote.com/docs/deepnote-ai) to disable any Generative AI or autocomplete in your notebook.

**Increasing Notebook Timeout.** If you notice that after a few minutes, the machine running your notebook shut off, you're welcome to increase the timeout following [these instructions](https://deepnote.com/docs/long-running-jobs).



## Submitting Homework

Given challenges with DeepNote and Gradescope, follow the instructions for submission listed on the schedule.

<!--

**Uploading.**
1. Run each notebook from start to finish (with no interruptions) so we can see the output of every cell.
2. Download the `.ipynb` files of your notebooks from DeepNote.
3. Using [this tool](https://www.convert.ploomber.io/pdf?converter=nbconvert-webpdf), convert your `.ipynb` files to `.pdf` files (make sure the "WebPDF" format is selected). If for some mysterious reason, that doesn't work, try following [these instructions](https://deepnote.com/docs/export-pdf) instead (just don't forget to "delete the app" afterwards).
4. Navigate to the course's Gradescope and submit them there (please **only** submit the `.pdf` files).

**Checking.** Check to make sure that, in your *Gradescope* submission,
1. All cells have been run and their output is visible.
2. All images you included are showing.
3. You included the notebook for **every** checkpoint.
4. Your markdown text / math is not illegible because it was all put on the same line. 

Homework problems that do not include the output of the code, as described above, create substantial additional work for us to grade, and **will therefore be given zero credit**.

## Including Graphics in DeepNote

For some of the assignments, you'll have to draw figures (by hand, in google slides, or in some other way). To include these figures in a DeepNote notebook, follow these steps:
1. Upload your image to the `figs` directory in DeepNote.
2. Make sure this import statement is included: `from IPython.display import Image`.
3. In a *code* cell, write `Image('figs/FILENAME')`.



## Running Code Locally

The benefit of working in DeepNote is that no student should have installation issues---the environment is uniform for all students, and we've already taken care to ensure everything works. Students who prefer to complete the assignments locally on their own machines can follow the instructions here. However, we note that we unfortunately cannot help troubleshoot installation issues.

1. Create a virtual python environment with python $3.10$. We recommend using [Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html) for this.
2. Then run the following commands in your terminal:
```
# Install Python packages
wget -O "requirements.txt" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mogu-lab/probabilistic-foundations-of-ml/master/requirements.txt"
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# Get the course's helper libraries
wget -O "deepnote_init.py" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mogu-lab/probabilistic-foundations-of-ml/master/scripts/deepnote_init.py"
python deepnote_init.py

# Create a directory for uploading figures
mkdir -p figs
```
